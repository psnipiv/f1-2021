####  Formula 1 Heineken Gran Premio D'italia 2021
 
Autodromo Nazionale Monza, Italy, also known as "The Temple of Speed" is located at the city of Monza, north of Milan, Italy which was built in the year 1922. The site has three tracks 1. Grand Prix track with 5.793 KM, 2. Junior track with 2.405 KM and 3. high-speed oval track with 4.250 KM, which has been unused for many decades.
Monza is a power circuit as it has long straights and tight chicanes. Good braking and tractions are very essential to race in Monza. As you can see, the cars are set up with one of the smallest wing angles in order to have the lowest level of drag on straights. Securing a pole position doesn't mean a race win at Monza. Consistent speed, tyre management and strategy are equally important.

The race format is different from the other race, with Practice 1 and Qualifying on Friday, followed by Practice 2 & Sprint race on Saturday 

Main race will be held on Sunday 12th September 2021 with a total 53 laps covering a race distance of 306.72 km.
