####  Formula 1 Heineken Dutch Grand Prix 2021 - Practice Session

This week 3rd to 5th September, Formula 1 is racing at Zandvoort.  Circuit Zandvoort race track is located in the dunes north of Zandvoort, Netherlands, near the North Sea coast line.  The Circuit now is liked by all the current F1 drivers and many of them had tackled in their junior category days. The circuit was modernised in time for F1's 2020 return (race for calendar 2020 was cancelled due to COVID) - including increasing the banking angle at the famous Tarzan corner to an Indianapolis Motor Speedway-trumping 18 degrees - Zandvoort will remain a proper, challenging driver's track. For the main race having Verstappen in the front row followed by the rival Mercedes, strategy is going to play a key role in the race win.

Main race will be held on Sunday 5th September 2021 with a total 72 laps covering a race distance of 306.648 km.
